# ctSESAM-GUI-java
This is a Java GUI frontend for the Java based **c't SESAM** password manager from the [pinae/ctSESAM-java](https://github.com/pinae/ctSESAM-java) project. This frontend uses a slightly skinned Nimbus L&F, as far as the underlaying Java runtime version supports it. Which means, if Nimbus is not supported by the Java runtime version the default Java runtime L&F is used instead.

The Java GUI frontend is localized in German and English language.
